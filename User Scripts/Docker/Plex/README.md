# ðŸ“º Plex Auto-Update Checker & Notifier

This Bash script checks for the latest **public release** of Plex Media Server, compares it with the currently running version inside a Docker container, and restarts the container if an update is available. It also sends notifications using the [Apprise API server](https://github.com/caronc/apprise-api), supporting services like Discord, Gotify, and more.
